## Compilation Instructions
How do we compile your program?
* At the top of Visual Studio, click the start button and it will run the program after a moment of compilation.

## Program Usage
How do we run your program? Does it expect any Inputs?
* The program will give you prompts to navigate the menus and add animals, print info, and modifies data.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
  * Following the instructions works, and some invalid inputs are covered in several sections of the menu, and the weight must be a double (or it might crash).
* What are the limitations of your program?
  * The only things that should break are if you try to put a string where an int should go. Vice versa might also be an issue though.
* What design decisions did you make?
  * I tried to make the prompts more accurate explanation wise, witout making it too wordy, and I tried to keep things simple by numbering all of the menu options to make selecting easier.
* Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
  * Not really, this was a lot. My head hurts. I want to sleep now. :)
